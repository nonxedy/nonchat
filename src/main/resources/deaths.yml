#     %player_name% - The player's name
#     %luckperms_prefix% - Player's LuckPerms prefix
#     - Player's LuckPerms suffix
#     (Any other PlaceholderAPI placeholder)
#
#   Death-specific placeholders:
#     {death_cause} - The cause of death (e.g., FALL, FIRE)
#     {killer_name} - Name of the killer (if applicable)
#     {killer_type} - Type of killer (PLAYER, ZOMBIE, etc.)
#     {world} - World where death occurred
#     {x}, {y}, {z} - Death coordinates
#
# Color Codes:
#   Legacy: Use & followed by color code (e.g., &c for red)
#   Hex: Use &#RRGGBB format (e.g., &#FF5252 for red)
